I am very excited to hear about the Software Engineer Intern position at Stripe, and formally submit my resume for consideration. I have learned about the opportunity through the career section of Stripe's website.
 
I am currently pursuing my Masterâ€™s in Computer Science at University of Texas, Dallas. I am experienced with writing robust and scalable code when I built an online auction web application which would allow ~1000 users to access the website at a time. I also had the opportunity to develop a text completion neural network model which would complete a sentence/phrase. These projects were built under 3 weeks and really exposed me to of different facets of programming. With such diverse experience, I see myself as a really good fit for the Software Engineer role at Tesla with the best mix of writing robust, scalable code, full stack knowledge and brainstorming ideas.
 
I can be reached anytime via email at vxg162630@utdallas.edu or my cell phone, 469-988-3937.
 
I am positive that I can bring your company many benefits with my experience, background, and forward thinking. I would welcome the opportunity to discuss my experience in greater detail, and look forward to hearing from you at your earliest convenience.
 
 
Regards,
Vinayaka Raju
