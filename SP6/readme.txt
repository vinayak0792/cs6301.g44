Problem 4:
Program to compute MST by PriorityQueue of edges using Prim's Algorithm 
How to input values for the program
5	<- number of vertices
7	<- number of edges
1	<- vertex 1
2	<- vertex 2
2	<- edge between vertex 1 and vertex 2; other values are similar input

Problem 2:
HuffTree.java - a class for representing coding trees
HuffmanCoding.java - Driver program which constructs the tree and outputs the encoding

For A (0.5) C (0.25) G (0.1) T (0.15) code is:
Code for A is: 0
Code for C is: 10
Code for G is: 110
Code for T is: 111
