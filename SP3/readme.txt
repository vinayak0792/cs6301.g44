1. 
Topological ordering of a DAG
TopologicalOrder.java - It has two functions toplogicalOrder1 and toplogicalOrder2
It uses Graph.java class

2.
StronglyConnectedDriver.java : Driver program to find no. of strongly connected components
StronglyConnectComp.java: Includes program that returns # of strongly connected components

3.
EulerianGraph.java : Checks if graph is strongly connected and for each vertex in-degree is equal to out-degree
DriverEularian.java : Driver program to check whether the graph is eulerian or not

5.
BridgeCutVertices.java : Driver program that checks for Bridges and Cut Vertices.
DFSBridges.java : Includes program that returns the bridges in a given graph.
